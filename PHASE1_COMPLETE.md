# Phase 1 Complete: Core Language Foundation ✅

## Summary

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of the Flow programming language implementation. The language now has a working foundation with lexing, parsing, type checking, and interpretation capabilities.

## Completed Components

### 1. Lexer (✅ Complete)
- Full tokenization of Flow syntax
- Support for all keywords, operators, and literals
- Triple-quoted strings for multi-line content
- Comment support
- Error reporting with line/column information

### 2. Parser (✅ Complete)
- Comprehensive AST definitions
- Recursive descent parser implementation
- Function parsing with metadata (intent, accepts, returns, tests)
- Expression parsing with proper precedence
- Pattern matching support (when/otherwise)
- Statement parsing (let, return, checkpoint, attempt/recover)
- Pipe operator support

### 3. Type System (✅ Complete)
- Type representations for all Flow types
- Type inference for expressions and literals
- Function type checking
- Binary and unary operator type checking
- Scope-based variable tracking
- Error reporting for type mismatches

### 4. Interpreter (✅ Complete)
- Runtime value system
- Environment with scope management
- Built-in functions (print, len, type)
- Complete expression evaluation
- Statement execution
- Pattern matching execution
- Function calls (user-defined and built-in)
- String concatenation with type conversion

### 5. CLI Interface (✅ Complete)
- File execution mode
- Interactive REPL
- Syntax checking mode (parser only)
- Test running mode (placeholder)
- Colored output for better UX

## Current Capabilities

The Flow language can now:

1. **Execute basic programs**:
   ```flow
   function greet(name):
     return "Hello, " + name + "!"
   
   print(greet("World"))  // Output: Hello, World!
   ```

2. **Perform arithmetic and logic**:
   ```flow
   let x = 10
   let y = 20
   print(x + y)  // Output: 30
   ```

3. **Use pattern matching**:
   ```flow
   function factorial(n):
     when n is 0: return 1
     when n is 1: return 1
     otherwise: return n * factorial(n - 1)
   ```

4. **Work with collections**:
   ```flow
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   let person = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
   ```

## What's Next

Phase 2 will focus on the testing framework:
- Inline test execution
- Property-based testing
- Checkpoint system
- Test coverage reporting

Phase 3 will add interoperability:
- Python integration
- JavaScript integration
- External tool support

## Try It Out

```bash
# Run a Flow program
cargo run -- run examples/hello.flow

# Start the REPL
cargo run -- repl

# Or just
cargo run
```
